>Calculator software for Arduino

It was spring 2018 and my three years old daughter came up with the idea of
building a cash register â€“ on our own. To this end, we manufactured a wooden case
with a built-in Arduino including display, keypad and RFID card reader.


Base: Arduino Uno connected to a 4x4 keypad and 8 x 7-segment display as well as an RFID card reader.
Parts of the code are based on a project of circuitdigest.com which you can find here: https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-calculator-using-4x4-keypad
